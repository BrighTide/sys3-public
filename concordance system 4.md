   "humanity is an infinitely strong infant, with exponentially growing power to imperil itself, but not yet the ability to think or act coherently in response. This is the true threat - we're in existential danger because our power at scale is growing so much faster than our agency at scale."

   "Agency at scale"

   "The Taylor impulse, could we please just... guys, please"

   "I have a growing suspicion that tools and contexts which cultivate broad consensus on what's real and important are going to be vital to us surviving as a species"

   "We are surrounded by a a vast confusion, a darkling plain where ignorant armies clash by night"
   
   "maybe we could dream a shared dream once again..."
   
   "healing the epistemic commons"

   "System 3 enhances personal coherence.
   System 4 is a multi-player sys3 that enhances collective coherence, generating agreement on what's real, important, what what is to be done.
   It's a developmental prosthetic for the complex times in which we live."

   "I think you don't want to build a tool, so much as a process, that connects information technology with institutions and populations"

   "What *context* (spiritual, technical, emotional, social) could better hold our efforts to make *shared* *sense* (meaning, truth, value) of our situation?"

   "The foundation of a democracy is its communicative culture. And a communication culture is shaped by the technologies that underlie it"

   "This is true even if the War on Terror itself has an arbitrary cost in people killed / money spent / freedoms lost. The FDA mandate is set the same way - we‚Äôre open to paying limitless costs, as long as it lets us avoid a very specific kind of scandal which the media will turn into 24-7 humiliation of whoever let it happen. If I were a politician operating under these constraints, I‚Äôm not sure I could do any better."

   "Achieving collective action is essentially a process of dissolving defective clusters, which is fundamentally limited by network topology at the cluster perimeters. Deliberately and carefully increasing connectivity between polarised clusters is a powerful mechanism for promoting cooperation. Replacing the mechanisms that generate and maintain polarisation with others that instead promote constructive engagement between disagreeing groups could be a powerful promoter of large-scale collective action."

   "Everyone from statisticians to Brexiteers knows that they are right. The only remaining problem is how to convince others. Go on Facebook and you will find a million people with a million different opinions, each confident in her own judgment, each zealously devoted to informing everyone else."

   As the old saying goes, "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then they fight you half-heartedly, then they‚Äôre neutral, then they then they grudgingly say you might have a point even though you‚Äôre annoying, then they say on balance you‚Äôre mostly right although you ignore some of the most important facets of the issue, then you win."

   "Given all of this, I reject the argument that Purely Logical Debate has been tried and found wanting. Like GK Chesterton, I think it has been found difficult and left untried."

   "Scaling the value of friendly dialectic among two good faith opponents"

   "What would the mass media equivalent of shifting from Twitter spats to serious debate, from transmission mindset to collaborative truth-seeking mindset be?"

   "if there are a thousand trustworthy people at a thousand different parts of the hurricane, then the stray gusts of wind will cancel out and they can average their readings to get something approaching a signal"

   "there is a particular need to provide tools for communities to track how they agree and disagree in principled ways." - Simon Buckingham Shum

   "I build tools that help large groups of people rapidly have *is*, *ought* and *how* conversations and reach consunsus"

   "Trading off ability to grip the world with clarity of vision and unity of purpose"

"Concordance is the ability of a group to find coherence with itself.
A System 4 is any system that enhances the ability of a group to do this.
I am considering starting a company to build system 4s"

## üìú Why?
   ## ü¶ã Why work on this?
      - Bottleneck:           Inability to find coherence with one another is the key bottleneck in our species's flourishing
      - Interest:             I have a sizeable interest in helping humanity find coherence with itself
      - Aptitude:             I have the skills, resources, and connections necessary to build a company that solves this problem
      - Useful Intuitions:    Ihe intuitions I have on what hinders and aids consensus are valuable, and systems build around them will help
      
      - Conclusion:           Increasing coherence-ability is the most important problem i can be working on

   ## üìç Why not work on this?
      - TAI: once tai is in play then whether humans can cohere between themselves may matter little
         - inadequate coherence may play a critical role in us failing to prevent x-risks including utai

         - maybe insight into the nature of adversarial coherence could help?
            - this feels like a justification
               - your counter counters too much
                  - never the less...

      - Rightness -> Concord: Focusing on rightness will lead to concord
         - [[dimensions of coherence#questions]]
      
      - Rightness > Concord: Rightness is more important than concord
         - "Who cares who agrees with you, *does reality agree* is the question you should be asking"

   ## üîÆ The Dream
      - Sell the dream, to your investors, your employees, and your users
      - The dream of cohering, of gaining traction on previously intractable issues we'd given up hope on
      - This is what's at stake, re-union with your neighbour, mutual understanding and respect, a path forward into the unknown where at least we're together
      - Regaining an ability to dream shared dreams, without losing ourselves to madness

## üí† Ideas that seem important
   ## üî• Discord & Wrongness Intuitions
      "Don't focus on the solution, focus on the problem, an inability to do *complex communication*"

      üß® DISCORD                       - "Our ability to resolve disagreement on what is real and important is inadequate"
         - "An increasing inability to cohere in the same epistemic and normative reality"
         - "Civilization is to groups what intelligence is to individuals. Civilization is a means of combining the intelligence of many to achieve ongoing group adaptation. Civilisation, like intelligence, may serve well, serve adequately, or fail to serve its adaptive function. When civilization fails to serve, it must disintegrate unless it is acted upon by unifying force."
      üîé WRONGNESS                     - "Our ability to discern the correct answers to what is real and important is inadequate"
         - "The world is increasingly beyond our ability to make sense of"
         - "Sensemaking is the ability to generate an understanding of the world around us so that we may decide how to respond effectively to it. When this breaks down within the individual, it creates an ineffective human at best and a dangerous one at worst. At the collective level, a loss of sensemaking erodes shared cultural and value structures. It renders us incapable of generating the collective wisdom necessary to solve complex the societal problems that produce a state of existential risk. When that happens, the centre cannot hold."
      
      üåç PRIORITY OVERWHELM         - "There's too much going on for us to be able to figure out what's right, let alone be in concordance"
      ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è COMPLEXITY                 - "Communicating complex, nuanced thoughts is *hard*. As the complexity of what needs to be communicated increases, as does the difficulty in cohering in response to it"
      ‚úä INADEQUATE LEADERSHIP      - "Our ability to generate sufficient mandate for effective leaders, also leaders are often wrong"
            - "We're all scared, we want to cohere but we fear our neighbours"
            - "Society struggles to give it's citizens something to live for. So we get pulled into peer to peer attractors to give us reality and meaning, and those "memetic tribes" end up at war. Who could lead such a mob?"

            - We're terrified of the future
            - When a group is decohered in the face of a threat, there is an impulse to give one person power, to seize on a shelling point and focus for coherence, someone who can get the group to act as one
            - But we're too scared to do that, if we surrender control to another that they'll go kill millions of Jews
            - This is the key bottleneck. Aligning *groups* with what's good and true (vector field diagram)
      
      üí• INADEQUATE WORKING MEMORY  - "When people disagree their working memory gets shorted and they crash, which makes it hard to cohere"
      ‚åõ INADEQUATE TIME            - "It's rare that members of a group have undistracted time to sit with the particulars of a disagreement before or after"
            - They either need to respond immediately, or when they do have time it's not front of mind
            - You and Wade surfacing a disagreement, being able to note it down, go away, process it, and then come back
            - Nate Otey: "giving people time *before* the mapping exercise to figure out what they think is quite helpful"
      
      üßä ICEBERG INSIDE VIEW        - "So much of what generates disagreement lays beneath the surface, and it's work to get it out. Externalising inside views is a difficult problem."
         - There's this sense, when disagreeing with someone like say Liam or Seb
         - That the flash point (say, Elon Musk) is the tip of an icebern that underlies a really complex difference in worldview / assumptions / experience
         - "Getting to the root of the disagreement"

      üëÅ EXPERIENCE                 - "People underestimate perhaps, the difference experience makes in latent intuitions about reality."
         - "Have you ever been exposed to the the variety of competence in decision makers / have you ever been at a start up"
         - "Have you ever been the victim of gendered violence?"
         - "Have you ever been poor surrounded by extravagance?"

      üí¢ DEFAULT FOCUS DISAGREE     - "By default, if a group is in disagreement the focus will be immediately drawn to what is disagreed on, even if what is agreed on is unclear"
      üôä FORGET TO SAY ITS WRONG    -  Sometimes I know why they're confused, this thing doesn't actually bottom out on the left side i'm still working on that, but it's hard to get around to saying that for some reason
         - there's this thing that happens, when someone is questioning
         - and in the back of my mind, i'm like "i know why they're confused, this thing doesn't actually bottom out on the left side i'm still working on that"
         - and it's not that you're hiding it it's that... idk you just kind of, forget? to say it? or there isn't time maybe?
         - and either they push until you reach it, or i have the presence of mind to say "you're not crazy, i see what you're saying this part is fuzzy"

      üò¨ DISAGREEMENT BEGETS FEAR   - "Being faced with either epistemic or normative disagreement can be intensely dissonant and fear inducing"

      üö´ FEAR BEGETS REJECTION      - "A legitimate reason people retain a state of discord is out of fear of the other. What context could hold this?"
         a context to hold the fear we have for one another
         humans can create gods
         these mountainous things which rule our lives (the state, religion, media, parents, society)
         humans create these things
         and sometimes the gods we create hurt other people
         hurt lots of people
      üõ° SHIELDED SACRED:           - There's an instinct to hide away what is felt to be sacred. It's hard to say "i'm really scared about our collective future, and what you said just hurt me" it's vulnerable
      üîê AGREEMENT IS FORGOTTEN:    - What is agreed upon is forgotten about, this is especially important for the normative/values agreement. 

      üí£ DERAILMENT                 - "When attempting complex communication, the process is often derailed, focusing long enough to resolve it is difficult especially when bad faith or fear is in play"
         - Not just "what does this mean" but "Why did they say that?"
         - Psycological safty, not getting derailed by protecting image
      üöÇ SWERVE                     - "when attempting to communicate, the train you're trying to send in can swerve onto a different track if it's bot pull to it
         that experience trying to send a train straight down into kathryn, and get an echo back of either "i understand on an emotional level what you're telling me" or "i don't have the experiences to understand".
   
         wanting to communicate to hols and david "if you want a separate place or having higher standards than us is too uncomfortable that's fine, but"
   
         that zvi(?) post, on explaining what you are saying, and what you're *not* saying

      *bad incentives*
      üí∏ CONCORD APATHY             - "People don't see coherence with one another as the ultimate goal"
      üì¢ DISCORD MOTIVATES          - (maybe overblown?) there's a profit and influence incentive to a state of discord

      üëæ ALIENATION -> DEFECTION    - "When people within the group don't feel included/represented it causes more problems that just missing correctness"
         "When I get together in community and deliberate about a problem, what‚Äôs important to me is that I feel heard, that I feel we are responding intelligently and compassionately, that what we‚Äôre working on is meaningful, that we are adaptable and efficient, that I‚Äôm a valued member of the community, that I‚Äôm seen, that I can count on the community to respond to my needs, that I can be proud to overlap my personal identity with our collective identity"

         Leaving people out of the process of collective agency doesn't just miss you out on mitis or utils.
         As radiation is to cancer, so alienation breeds social defection.
         We forget that civilisation and society is a contract between peoples, and those who feel alienated and disaffected don't have to go along with it if they don't feel it's favourable to them

         - Then there's no feedback / sign you've been heard and engaged with / that you moved the needle

         - [[hold us tight]]
         - [[social consilience through groking the sacred]]

      üì¢ EXPLOSIVE ANTI-THESIS      - Any tool or system designed to facilitate discourse will have to content with the explosive anti-thesis machine that is the internet

      - incentives to repeat and intensify
      - syncronous conversation is expensive and slow
      - lack of structure
      - perverse incentives undercut quality

      ‚ùì RIGHTNESS APATHY           - "People don't see cohering with objective reality (epistemic and normative) as the ultimate goal"
      ‚úä WRONG IS POWERFUL          - "If you have the power to control how reality is perceived by others, then you control them"
         - There will always be a large incentive for people to distort consensus reality
         - Suspicion that others are distorting consensus reality frequently gets in the way of coherence
      ‚ùå LEVEL 1 ANTI GRAVITY       - "The current condition gaslighting one another with no regard for the value of truth cannot hold"
         - [[coming back to level 1 global sanity]]

   ## üå≤ Concord & Rightness Intuitions
      üî± CONCORD                    - When a group is in concordance, it is powerful
      üöÄ RIGHTNESS                  - Humans and groups being more right (having a better understanding of what is true, and what is good) has proven to have massive impact on utility
            - Tegmark: "we need to generate multi scale alignment", this notion of the fractal secondments of alignment in people, nations, and companies
         
      ---

      üî• NECESSARY                  - "Improving ability to reach concordance is both high leverage and neglected"
         - Improvements in our ability to coordinate have been very good in the past
         - If you can effect a swath of the coordination environment (like with the printing press, the internet, google docs, wordpress, facebook) that can be high leverage for good
         - "to tinker with our shared sense making apparatus is to tinker with civilisation, our categories of thoughts our decisions our institutions, everything"
         - Taiwan seems to be getting a lot of milage out of it
      üõ† POSSIBLE                   - "Improving ability to reach concordance is possible, and has precedents"
         üèà SCRUM                      - "Scrum is a social process (supported by technical tools and processes) that helps software teams be both right and concordant"
            - There are rituals 
         üè∞ TAIWAN
         ü§ù NVC
      üî± SYSTEM 4                   - "System 4 is about building a process that helps a group find maximum trades off in rightness, concordance, and ability to act"

      üëë NEW ELITE                  - "A growing portion of sense-making is done by public intellectuals with a following" 
         - The system via which we choose and interact with "elites" has changed, tools are built which accidently or deliberatly play a part in this
         - Twitter, substack, clubhouse, etc

      *concord aids*
      üó° FOILS                      - "Having a central foil around which to focus the process of coherence seems important"
         - Being clear on the initial train station
         - Having something to come back to when working memory crashes
         
         - If you're working to develop a set of ideas that model reality in some way
         - Then having some hypothetical example of the reality to be modelled is required
         - Similar to a thesis statement
         - Can be a quote, a question, a point of disagreement

      üç≥ PATIENT FOSSICKING         - "When facing discord, going slow and surfacing common knowledge of what exactly is agreed/disagreed on is really important"
         - (imagining talking with rand, how slowly you'd have to move and how diligent you'd have to be in building the agreement corpus)
      üî¨ ONE THING AT A TIME        - "Being able to zoom in on particular issues / considerations and not move on until resolved"
      üß± GROUNDEDNESS               - "Staying grounded in experience, prediction, and feeling, and the desire to establish consensus"
         - "I feel quite angry"
         - "I predict if you did that 100 times X would happen more often"
         - "I tried that once, and X happened"
         - When you were making sense of things with Wade, what worked best was working from particular cases
      
      ‚ôü TURN BASED                 - In some ways, the optimal dialectic feels a bit like chess. Making slow and considered moves, "pushing changes" to the shared graph. Slowly building up shared context with someone
      üé§ RECORDED                   - Recording the process over which the context is built feels important, how they got there. (timelinize and or record)
      
      ü§ù FOREGROUND AGREEMENT       - "Many intense arguments can be diffused by first being specific about what we agree upon / getting it locked away."
      üî• DISAGREEMENT IS MOTIVATING - "Humans find resolving disagreement to be quite energizing / motivating"
      üë¨ DIALECTIC SEEMS IMPORTANT  - There's something about two people collaborating to build synthesis. Often you don't know where to start but you do have a reaction to what someone said. 
         - Potentially also then acting as avatars for a wider array of stances
      üå° MATTERS OF DEGREES         - Being able to express degrees of agreement and disagreement is important. "I have sympathy for this" VS "Kind of" VS "I have no sympathy for this"

      üéÇ EPISTEMIC + NORMATIVE      - "It seems important to have a tool that interleaves is and ought claims"
      üìù INCREASE WORKING MEMORY    - "Working memory is a key bottle neck. Whiteboards are a miracle because they increase working memory"
         - This is why whiteboards, todo lists and wikis are so useful
         - Not just size and speed of working memory but also being able to reload next session

      üò∂ FOCUS ON IDEAS             - "When ideas are being collectively examined rather than communicated it helps people be more dispassionate and generous"
         - Nate Otey from argumentmapping: "Using an thought mapping tool to display arguments has a large impact on the vibe of the discourse not just positive epistemic effects. It lets people be more dispasionare and generous, focusing on the idea more, not the person"
      üóª CONTEXT                    - "It's quite helpful to be able to explore the deeper reasons why a person thinks that"
      üß™ CLARIFYING                 - "Part of what you're doing when mapping an argument is stripping out all the things that are not the argument, stripping it down to the core claims"

      üåå HYPER THOUGHTS             - "Hyper thoughts are a mix of feelings, experiences, and interpretations that have a kind of gestalt but are hard to communicate"
         - being able to use a collection of podcast snippets, tweets, and LW articles can kind of triangulate what you're trying to communicate
         - Thesis: Often hard disagreements come down to a clash in really complex hyper thoughts that give conflicting intuitions

      üìÇ CANONICAL HANDLES          - "There's something very helpful about having a neutral canon with which to refer to concepts and issues"
      ‚ûó FACTORING                  - "Being able to factor stance space and see the agreement breakdown by cohort seems *really important*"
         - ![](/assets/2023-01-18-09-06-18.png)
         - factoring into epistemic, normative, and causal
         - physical, emotional, social, mental
         - influence, truth, importance, agreement

      üëî REPRESENTATION             - "The phenomenon of choosing someone who represents you to argue on your behalf feels important, like an avatar for your way of being"
         - Liquid democracy?
   
      *ingota*
      üî± Ingota                     - "A system that lets you *demarcate*, *handlify*, *collapse*, *annotate*, and *relate* any thought can be really useful in a complex dialectic"

      *resolutions*
      üöÄ FOREGROUND RESOLUTION      - "Engaging with disagreement can be immensely valuable *if* there's a path to a resolution"
         - I have this same feeling in kialo, S.L, and swarm check
         - it's maybe not enough to just map the argument, the tool / argument itself needs to be able to iterate towards a state of synthisis / conclusion
      ü§ù SUPPORT AGREEMENT          - "If it turns out two people agree after all, well great"
      ‚öñ SUPPORT CHANGE MIND        - "Foreground, support, and note when someone updates / changes their mind on something / comes to some new understanding / records the flip"
      üìà SUPPORT CBD                - "If two people can agree on a cost benefit distribution, all the better"
      üéå SUPPORT CRUXES             - "A focus on finding double cruxes can turn intractable disagreements into productive discussions"
         - "What would make me change my mind"
         - **pushing people towards finding cruxes that lead to forecasts feels really important**

      üí∞ SUPPORTING PREDICTION      - "Prediction pulls people down simulacra levels, it lets them communicate authenticity and promotes internal dissent"
         - Can extend beyond just betting in the dialectic, but for the crowd also"
      üßÆ SUPPORTING POLLING         - "Being able to know what cohorts of people think rather than having to guess is really helpful"
         "Polling my boy, it's all polling, always has been"

         "High grade polling infrastructure to solicit and aggregate information from verified demographics seems to be a necessary primitive for groups of millions to overcome bad equilibria"

         - Could include innovations like *liquid democracy* or *quadratic voting*, not just for voting but also agenda setting
         - "Polling + prediction from verified cohorts (experts, citizens, etc)"
         - Prediction
         - Unique and Collective Identification
      üíå SUPPORTING VOTING          - "pre-committing to a course of action based on a poll is really helpful, voting = crux + polling"

      üß∑ RELATE                     - "Communicating information about the ideas through the card relationship"
         - "It is important to note that the model is not a causal model per se. An edge from one node to another does not necessarily imply that the first causes the second, but rather that there is some relationship between them such that information about the first informs the probability estimate for the second. Some edges do represent causal relationships, but only insofar as that relationship is important for informing probability estimates."

      üîÄ ANNOTATE VS RELATE          - For polling and prediction, can either be a seperate card, or an annotation
         - *expresses a thought*: "yes, i'll sign on to that I think it represents me"

      *things that really seem to help to be able to express easily alongside thoughts*
      üî• FEELINGS                   - "Expressing 'this idea is quite dry, but this one has a lot of feeling around it, i feel hurt' or something"? being able to express umbridge
      ‚úù SACREDNESS                 - "Expressing 'please, this is sacred to me. i don't expect you to agree with what i want to do, but please respect this'"?
         - Also recalling what is held sacred in common
      üîÆ SEEMINGS                   - "Expressing 'here is my model of what's going on for you / what you'd say about this'"
         - "Are you worried about X?"
         - "Here's my model of what you care about / why you'd not like what I have to say"
   
      üòÆ REACTION                   - "Nuanced means for expressing reaction to an idea"
                                 - this seems factually incorrect
                                 - this wants sharpening as to whether i can agree
                                 -  can't say what i don't like but gives be bad vibes
                                 - i don't like the implications of this
                                 - "...i will admit I'm sympathetic to this"
      ü¶ã BUTTERFLY THOUGHTS:        - "Expressing how exploratory / tentative a thought is"
      üò¨ MOTH THOUGHTS:             - "Expressing how endorsed the thought is"
      üî± SEPARATE IS/OUGHT/HOW      - "Support for rich expression of epistemic VS normative thoughts. Is, ought, and how conversations should be distinct yet integrated"
         - So often a disagreement in one of these domains benefits from cycling into another
         - This is the insight behind double cruxes
         - "Is": double crux
         - "Ought": vote
         - "How": predict
         - Maybe also experience differences?
            - "this happened to me" VS "this is an idea that seems true"
            - "i grew up in the soviet union" vs "centralised governments are bad"
         - Ways of seeing VS seeing different things
         - a chunk here can be at the least:
            - claims about the world
            - expressions of values
            - epistemic or normative reactions to other thoughts
            - predictions
            - offers of compromise

      ‚úè TRANSCRIPTION              - "I keep coming back to the value of recording and transcribing a conversation as a dialectic aid"
         - "No more talking past one another, get your audio transcribed and chunked on the fly so you can ask what they meant"
         - there's also something very strong / compelling about recording conversation and converting to text. 
            imagine like, being able to play back a big conversation you and wade had, individuate key points and be like *that, that's the point of contention*. 
            being able to *factor* out points of agreement and contention
      üì¶ PERSISTENCE                - "Having a clear and persistent representation of an idea that can capture attention rather than it being re-iterated also seems important"
         people go round and round in the same arguments online
         the rich pay no tsx -> it's weath it'll be taxed when realised -> loans -> principle is realised -> estate taxes
         there needs to be a way to generate concept handles on the fly, some way to organise a discussion
         how can the public talk about consideration 3.4 (4 points into a third major consideration)
         
         - a whiteboard / system3 can, to some extent, make up for a lack of space, because you don't lose your place
      ‚òÅ CHUNKING + POLLING         - "Being able to represent discrete ideas and see if they are agreed on and who agrees seems important"

         - Incentivising the work of breaking up / factoring stances to find frontiers of agreement / parateo optimality
      
      üí∞ CROWD FUNDING              - "There's something interesting in other people being interested in certain dialectic pairings"
         - A bunch of money goes in, and the pair has to make foils that others agree on or something
         - "Oh, you made a link between a core thought of Person A and Person B, who usually disagree strongly! Have a big reward <3!"

            - Does it make sense for people to spend the same currency agreeing with normative claims and betting on epistemic ones?
            - "a crypto currency is valuable to the extent it's design legibly entangles it with things that are valuable"

      SWARM - Rewarding the crowd for helping (finding coherence, agreeing disagreeing, taking and making bets, linking to other cards in the canon?)

      *discord can beget rightness*

   üôè Guided by the beauty of our weapons
      1. Debate where two people with opposing views are talking to each other (or writing, or IMing, or some form of bilateral communication). Not a pundit putting an article on Huffington Post and demanding Trump supporters read it. Not even a Trump supporter who comments on the article with a counterargument that the author will never read. Two people who have chosen to engage and to listen to one another.

      2. Debate where both people want to be there, and have chosen to enter into the debate in the hopes of getting something productive out of it. So not something where someone posts a ‚ÄúHILLARY IS A CROOK‚Äù meme on Facebook, someone gets really angry and lists all the reasons Trump is an even bigger crook, and then the original poster gets angry and has to tell them why they‚Äôre wrong. Two people who have made it their business to come together at a certain time in order to compare opinions.

      3. Debate conducted in the spirit of mutual respect and collaborative truth-seeking. Both people reject personal attacks or ‚Äògotcha‚Äô style digs. Both people understand that the other person is around the same level of intelligence as they are and may have some useful things to say. Both people understand that they themselves might have some false beliefs that the other person will be able to correct for them. Both people go into the debate with the hope of convincing their opponent, but not completely rejecting the possibility that their opponent might convince them also.

      4. Debate conducted outside of a high-pressure point-scoring environment. No audience cheering on both participants to respond as quickly and bitingly as possible. If it can‚Äôt be done online, at least do it with a smartphone around so you can open Wikipedia to resolve simple matters of fact.

      5. Debate where both people agree on what‚Äôs being debated and try to stick to the subject at hand. None of this ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to vote Trump because I think Clinton is corrupt‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúYeah, but Reagan was even worse and that just proves you Republicans are hypocrites‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hypocrites? You Democrats claim to support women‚Äôs rights but you love Muslims who make women wear headscarves!‚Äù Whether or not it‚Äôs hypocritical to ‚Äúsupport women‚Äôs rights‚Äù but ‚Äúlove Muslims‚Äù, it doesn‚Äôt seem like anyone is even trying to change each other‚Äôs mind about Clinton at this point.

      These to me seem like the bare minimum conditions for a debate that could possibly be productive.

      But in other ways it‚Äôs a lot like the five points above. You have two people who disagree ‚Äì the patient thinks she‚Äôs a worthless loser who everyone hates, and the therapist thinks maybe not. They meet together in a spirit of voluntary mutual inquiry, guaranteed safe from personal attacks like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre crazy!‚Äù. Both sides go over the evidence together, sometimes even agreeing on explicit experiments like ‚ÄúAsk your boyfriend tonight whether he hates you or not, predict beforehand what you think he‚Äôs going to say, and see if your prediction is accurate‚Äù. And both sides approach the whole process suspecting that they‚Äôre right but admitting the possibility that they‚Äôre wrong (very occasionally, after weeks of therapy, I realize that frick, everyone really does hate my patient. Then we switch strategies to helping her with social skills, or helping her find better friends).

      And contrary to what you see in movies, this doesn‚Äôt usually give a single moment of blinding revelation. If you spent your entire life talking yourself into the belief that you‚Äôre a loser and everyone hates you, no single fact or person is going to talk you out of it. But after however many months of intensive therapy, sometimes someone who was sure that they were a loser is now sort of questioning whether they‚Äôre a loser, and has the mental toolbox to take things the rest of the way themselves.

      Logical debate has one advantage over narrative, rhetoric, and violence: it‚Äôs an asymmetric weapon. That is, it‚Äôs a weapon which is stronger in the hands of the good guys than in the hands of the bad guys. In ideal conditions (which may or may not ever happen in real life) ‚Äì the kind of conditions where everyone is charitable and intelligent and wise ‚Äì the good guys will be able to present stronger evidence, cite more experts, and invoke more compelling moral principles. The whole point of logic is that, when done right, it can only prove things that are true.

      We‚Äôre surrounded by a a vast confusion, ‚Äúa darkling plain where ignorant armies clash by night‚Äù, with one side or another making a temporary advance and then falling back in turn. And in the middle of all of it, there‚Äôs this gradual capacity-building going on, where what starts off as a hopelessly weak signal gradually builds up strength, until one army starts winning a little more often than chance, then a lot more often, and finally takes the field entirely. Which seems strange, because surely you can‚Äôt build any complex signal-detection machinery in the middle of all the chaos, surely you‚Äôd be shot the moment you left the trenches, but ‚Äì your enemies are helping you do it. Both sides are diverting their artillery from the relevant areas, pooling their resources, helping bring supplies to the engineers, because until the very end they think it‚Äôs going to ensure their final victory and not yours.

      A parable: Sally is a psychiatrist. Her patient has a strange delusion: that Sally is the patient and he is the psychiatrist. She would like to commit him and force medication on him, but he is an important politician and if push comes to shove he might be able to commit her instead. In desperation, she proposes a bargain: they will both take a certain medication. He agrees; from within his delusion, it‚Äôs the best way for him-the-psychiatrist to cure her-the-patient. The two take their pills at the same time. The medication works, and the patient makes a full recovery.

      You believe your mind is a truth-sensing instrument that does at least a little bit better than chance. You have to believe that, or else what‚Äôs the point? But it‚Äôs like one of those physics experiments set up to detect gravitational waves or something, where it has to be in a cavern five hundred feet underground in a lead-shielded chamber atop a gyroscopically stable platform cooled to one degree above absolute zero, trying to detect fluctuations of a millionth of a centimeter. Except you don‚Äôt have the cavern or the lead or the gyroscope or the coolants. You‚Äôre on top of an erupting volcano being pelted by meteorites in the middle of a hurricane.

      If you study psychology for ten years, you can remove the volcano. If you spend another ten years obsessively checking your performance in various metis-intensive domains, you can remove the meteorites. You can never remove the hurricane and you shouldn‚Äôt try. But if there are a thousand trustworthy people at a thousand different parts of the hurricane, then the stray gusts of wind will cancel out and they can average their readings to get something approaching a signal.

      All of this is too slow and uncertain for a world that needs more wisdom now. It would be nice to force the matter, to pelt people with speeches and documentaries until they come around. This will work in the short term. In the long term, it will leave you back where you started.

      If you want people to be right more often than chance, you have to teach them ways to distinguish truth from falsehood. If this is in the face of enemy action, you will have to teach them so well that they cannot be fooled. You will have to do it person by person until the signal is strong and clear. You will have to raise the sanity waterline. There is no shortcut.

      - it's confusing that pros under a con are supportive of the con side

      - there wants to be some kind of quantification
      - "drugs cause harm" how much harm??

      - wants concept handles

      - wants like "claim:"

      - the introduction being on the same level as the claims are weird

      - wants handles "decommisioned immediately", "decomissioned as scheduled", "extended", "extended with upgrades"

      - wants breadcrumb context
         - when looking at a node 5 layers down I want like
         - "decomissioned as scheduled" > economic > "redundant & non-competative"

      - I like the references, would be nice if they could be commented on

      - I want to be able to situate myself in the argument

      - I want the sense that points roll up into a conclusion, that once I've investigated the sub points I'm like yeah, this makes sense

      - "how many other people have investigated these sub points and been like "yeah, these do roll up"

      - it needs something to *ground* the conversation like
         - "okay, well, if it stayed in operation what would it's profit and loss be" or something

      - 1. being able to roll things up in a satisfactory way
      - 2. grounding the discussion in prediction, agreements, and cruxes

      - "a topic is an elephant that's difficult to wrap the mind around, what goes into eatting it"
      - what goes into metabolising a complex topic
       Things I find interesting about what they're doing:
         - They preserve the y-axis information ordering like prose rather than use a free-form web, but can still express "expand collapse" information using the x-axis

         - They have a "tree of nodes -> prose on a page" mapping tool, but the page is enhanced so you can expand / collapse nodes and follow links within it @‚Å®Adam‚Å© 

         - The library frame for a sys4 is really interesting. They centrally manage and groom these policy webs with an army of smart interns & volunteers to create a kind of "canonical reference" for the debate rather a social-media-esk approach (the people involved used to work on https://canonicaldebatelab.com/, and then I think they rebranded into "society library")

         - They also have contacts in government departments that lets them canonicalize a whole bunch of relevant government documents and data


      As I understand it, this project is trying to act as a canonical "multi perspective" source for civic issues. Like a centrally managed Wikipedia page that's formed around the different perspectives / arguments on an issue. I'm not sure what Charles was meaning, but from my end I could see the relevance to predictions markets:

      1. If it does manage to gain a measure of "canonical-ness" then if it referenced a predictions as a part of it's web it could help focus the attention on the market on a signal prediction
      2. Rather than a discrete policy issue, they could make big predictions the root node in their graphs

## üöÄ Product Ideas 
   Let's say that there's an amount of collective sense making happening *somewhere out there*. Your options:
   
   1. Find where it's happening and improve that context
      - Improve facebook/twitter
   2. Make a new context and invite people in to replace the old one
      - New facebook/twitter
   3. Create sense-making where there wasn't before
         - A platform that's never existed (i.e Get pairs of intelligentsia to do an adversarial colab in a garden)

   - POLLING INFRASTRUCTURE: Pure and simple polling infrastructure. Ask verified demographics questions. Maybe even make a protocol?
      - How do you decide which questions get answered?
         - Could use money / voting to aggregate and prioritise questions
      - How would you identify people?
         - Existing legacy id mechanism
         - Existing new id mechanism (eye tracker)
         - Implement the social graph primative

      What would a decentralized protocol for prediction and polling look like?
      User defined lists with luminaries holding them up
      Anyone can create a poll or prediction or whatever and post it to a channel
      You can set notifications based on people or channels

   - TWITTER: epistemic overlay to twitter, support people doing double/ agreement tweets, predictions, etc

   - WIKIPIDIA: epistemic overlay / integration

   - OMNI: a tool that sits between arbitrary sys3's and makes them interoperable

   - DIALECTICA / VAMP: [[Dialectica]]

   - SAME DREAM:  Dialectica but for movements

   - THE SQUARE: A place millions of people can do sense-making together?
      - maybe kind of like civic library
      - but it's decentralised, people build up the maps and vote on them and what have you

## üíÄ The Skulls
   - Where does Kialo go wrong?
   
   - Where does pol.is go wrong?
   
   - What is you answer to the skulls, re "webs of thought"
      - "There must be a reason why:
         a. so many smart driven people get inspired by this cluster of projects
         b. they fail so reliably

      - (why is *this* the equilibirum?)
      - it seems like a bunch of people have taken a crack at this
      - why did they fail?
      - "complex sales" attacking principle agent sales, "the challenger sale" "spin selling"
      - is this what is actually missing?

      - Paal: "The idea is old, and there is a big graveyard of projects aiming for the same goal. That being said, I think a project of this sort has amazing upsides. 
               There are many smart people working on this idea, or very similar ideas right now, and I am confident that something like this is going to happen at some point. "

      - markus strasse: "I‚Äôve been flirting with this entire cluster of ideas including open source web annotation, semantic search and semantic web, public knowledge graphs, nano-publications, 
                        knowledge maps, interoperable protocols and structured data, serendipitous discovery apps, knowledge organization, communal sense making and academic literature/publishing toolchains
                        for a few years on and off ... **nothing of it will go anywhere**.
                        Don‚Äôt take that as a challenge. Take it as a red flag and run. Run towards better problems.

## üìú Scratch

   14-01-23 08.31: There's a similar intuition with whentho, like the intractable feeling of 5 people across timezones finding coherence around a time

   14-01-23 08.31: The seeming intractability of two people across o tologies and ideologies finding agreement / a path forward. Where the timeslot equivalent is finding a course of action

   14-01-23 09.02: Dialectic Stan

   14-01-23 09.02: "tools to supercharge dialectic"
   Being able to see the canonical dialectic on an issue
   Where does Khali go wrong?

   14-01-23 09.02: Foregrounding the dialectic (foil, disagreement, consensus)

   14-01-23 09.02: What tool could reliably facilitate Sam Haris and Ezra Zlien finding coherence
   Scott Alexander and Glen Wyl
   
   (Feature: proposing something you think they'd say "here's my model of what you care about)

   14-01-23 09.03: Tag a thought chunk with feelings?

   14-01-23 09.04: Demarcate, annotate, compose and share thought (vision of a sentence pulled out into a box, tagged with who agrees with it and slotted back into prose)

   14-01-23 09.55: *professional opinion haver / professional dialectical" getting paid to hash things out with other 0undits

   14-01-23 09.57: "Alexander V Wyl" 2020

   15-01-23 18.53: When two public intellectuals take the time to hash through their differences in a legible fashion, it's useful work and they should be rewarded

   15-01-23 18.53: Crowd funding adversarial collaborations

   15-01-23 19.10: Thesis: the speed at which a dialectic resolves can be greatly increased by methodological changes

   In a good demo¬≠cracy the more complex answers to life‚Äôs problems can emerge, answers that are more inclusive to a multiplicity of interests and perspectives. In a poor demo¬≠cracy, the lowest co¬≠mmon denominator sets the limit.

   "that intuition, if you want to someone to challenge deeply held ideals they need to be supported in this, and their "opponent" needs to feel humble nad truth seeking

   software that allows for both the back and forward and the branching nature of dialog

   this when where I want to break the things they say into seperate thoughts, and then address them "hmmm, okay interesting so that brings up two thoughts"
