   "ingota" is a system for chunking thought & arranging it to communicate relationship between those thoughts"

   "maybe it's our ability to chunk and orchestrate thought that's important / needs improving..."

   "Demarcate, annotate, compose and share thought (vision of a sentence pulled out into a box, tagged with who agrees with it and slotted back into prose)"

   "White boards are chunking + memory + relating"

   "Ingota comes from the quasi system I've hacked together in vscode that relies primarily on code folding and line ordering to chunk and move thought around"


🔱 Features
   "Intuitions and ideas about what would be important to have in a system like this"

   *cards*   
   - 🔳 Demarcate:      "Ingota supports adding demarcated thoughts on an infinite canvas. The card is the new sentence."
      - These cards can then be related and annotated in helpful ways
      - There seems to be something key to this process of breaking a set of thoughts into cards and giving them an easy concept handle
      - And then zooming out to swing those handles like kettle bells / strum them like guitar strings
      - "That feeling when you see the kialo break down, the civic lib breakdown, or the wiki debate breakdown like "yep, that pretty much covers the key considerations that I'm aware of, and it's *chunked*"
   - ✏ Annotate:       "Annotating cards allows for highly compressed expressions of thoughts related to the thought or other information about it. How tentative it is, whether it has agreement, etc"
   - 📛 Type:           "Cards can have *types* that enable certain ui functionality"
      - Question, Prediction, Statement, Belief, Value, Conclusion, Action, Suggestion, Take-away
   - 📂 Handlify:       "Cards can be given a title to act as a *concept handle* to represent it, and collapsed to show only the concept handle"
   - 🌺 Collapse:       "Cards can be collapsed under other cards across multiple dimensions (side in, below in, etc)
   - ✏ Relate:         "Information can be expressed as *relationships between cards*, with the full meaning of the card expressed in it's relationships"
      - There are many dimensions you could bring in to this:
         - left, right, up, down
         - sub-left, sub-right, sub-up, sub-down (to the right, could be a peer, sub right is a child, etc)
         - behind & in-front
   
      - Something critical happens when you examine the relationship of one card to another

      - This intuition that topological representation of handlified ideas can express really complex thoughts
         - The civic library, kialo, Lillian's web
         - There's this idea that *the thoughts that hang between the thoughts* are really important
         - Webs of thought have a big limitation though, they're hard to read.
         - of note, in the past you've dealt with this by:
            - Spelling the web out in prose
            - Building it up a block at a time
         - "The web never works. The information contained in a linear ordering is too important, a web is a mess."
         - Pay attention to the skulls
   - 🌈 Anything:       "You can put anything in a card, text blob, other cards, a recording, video, a tweet, a prediction, a webpage, itself, *a portion of any of the above*, or a *combination of any of the above*"
         - It needs to be easy to cut and paste / click and drag a link and have it pop in (paste a link, show a tweet)
         - Eventually you could make it easy to search and add things
   - 👉 Orchestrate:    "You can move things around easily with respect for indentation, whether up down, left right, or cut paste"

   - 📏 Linear:         "Vertical and horizontal ordering of cards is well supported / doesn't have to be a web"
      - much like newline
      - vertical progression encodes a lot

   - ⚡ Smooth:         "The speed and ease with which you can manipulate cards is a core and vital feature"
      - "add a card where my cursor is"
      - "an important part of sys4, is hotkeys to segment thought new line, new paragraph, new block, new file, new map and then hot keys to move between segments and relate them to one another"
   - ✂ Snipping:       "It needs to be easy to highlight something and turn it into a card"
   - 🎶 Compose:        "Cards can be composed into prose while retaining the link"

   *maps*
   - 🗺 Maps:              "Once a card contains other cards, it's called a map card"

   - 🔍 Zoom In:        "Can zoom in on a card and ignore everything else"
      - "There is something very valuable about being able to zoom in / focus on just one thought and exclude everything else"
   - 🌌 Zoom Out:       "There are many methods for 'zooming out' so as to fit more cards on screen"
      - There is also something critical about being able to example many cards at once to get a unified gestalt of the over-all picture
      - once you have highly compressed bundles of highly compressed thoughts and think *yes, that's it, that's everything*
      
      - Making the text smaller
      - Collapsing cards
      - Un-line wrapping, etc
   - 🖼 Frames:         "Being able to draw a boundary around a set of cards and zoom to it"
      - "one person zoom out view is not another's, different frames on how thoughts connect emphasise different things"

   - 🥫 Canon:                "Cards can be pulled in & adapted from your own and other's canvases, leading to a sort of *canon* of ideas"
      - If you were so inclined there could be a "rationalist canon" or "ea canon"

   *collaboration*
   - 🎮 Multi-player:   "Similar to miro or google docs, one feels they are in a shared space with some else"
      - Seeing who's viewing the map currently
      - Seeing their cursor / current selection
   - 📰 Change Management: "git-like features giving the ability to manage change to cards"
      - really just knowing what changed seems like the big one

   *misc*
   - 🌉 Bridge:            "You can relate cards within a map to cards outside it, or within other maps"
   - ⚡ One Click:         One click takes you straight to the item the card represents
   
   - 🎃 I&O:               Can create the things that cards represent in-app (like tweets, etc)
   - 🔀 BYO Editor:        Intuition that there's big value in people editing the text in whatever tool they normally use to chunk thought
   - 🤖 AI CHUNKING:       I that understands language could potentially be helpful in translating prose into a format that's factored / 

Cards or Lines?
   - There's something to thinking about a line in a text editor as a "card"
   - what if it wasn't so much a whiteboard as a text editor, with rich annotate, handlify, collapse, and relate features for lines
   - adapt an existing open source text editor?
   - bc this is what you're doing right, when you do this: (- bla: "my stuff") it's like a card, and the bla is the concept handle
   - and then you're using tabs to relate and collapse

Thots
   thought editor
      The technology of the sentence and paragraph to chunk, orchestrate, and communicate thoughts is something of an unacknowledged marvel.
      Maybe I want to build a text editor
      But it's more like a thought editor
      Something that will receive and orchestrate blobs of thought itself, something that goes beyond sentence and paragraph

      "what tool could become as ubiquitous as excel or text files for thought?"

   thought types
      *thought* here can be at the least:
         - claims about the world
         - expressions of values
         - epistemic or normative reactions to other thoughts
         - predictions
         - offers of compromise
