"Whither the argument may blow, thither we go."

"responding to the way unskilful disagreement feels"

"A tool that facilitates two people building a web of agreement and disagreement"

"Facilitating 1-1 representational disagreement"

"Putting head sinks and exhaust on the engine that is disagreement"

"The internet had been great for thesis and anti thesis, we can make something that optimises for synthesis"

The opposite of twitter. Slow, deliberate, 1-1, and strong affordances for keeping things private

Thesis: the speed at which a dialectic resolves can be greatly increased by methodological changes

Logo: two circles reaching out to one another within a larger one

## 💠 Seems Important
   ⚓ REBOOT ANCHORS:   Having clear and easy things to "reboot" from when conversation gets derailed
      - "Reboot from finding coherence"
      - "Reboot from the foil / thesis"

   🤝 SHARED PROJECT:   Wants to feel like building something together / a shared project

   🧪 PROCESS:          This can't just be a tool, it has to be a process.
      - Or maybe, better to say that the gains from incorperating a process with the tool are big compared to better tooling alone
      - Like scrum. Jira alone VS Jira + the scrum process
      - Maybe a bad example 😬

   👩‍⚖️ MODERATORS:       People who can embody lawful neutral
      - Those who understand what is being attempted by the project

   💰 ATTRACTION:       What would make this tool attractive to the masses?
      - People cheer big for seeing their point of view represented
      - People cheer bigger for seeing person who legibly disagrees with it agree?
      - What are the intricate emotional contoured of the 1-1 representational disagreement observed by a crowd

   🥊 GRUDGE MATCH:     Team searching for grudge match style show downs in a many communities as possible
   
   ⚡ AVATARS:          Individuals find themselves all-of-a-sudden channelling the zeitgeist
      "Channeling swaths of disagreement into individual who are given the *tools* and *processes* to hold it productively"

Features
   - "Different colours for different people"
   - "A colour for synthesis / statement made together / coherence?"

   - Being able to shift the foil backwards

   - Being able to offer a rephrasing

   - Mutual signing on / off about what in the demarcated graph is shared
   
   - Strong normals & mechanisms around screenshotting / keeping things priviate
      - "X would like to take a screenshot, is this okay?"

   - "Agree and publish"

## 📋 The Process
   - Check-ins? "How are you today, what were you doing before this, how do you feel about what's to come?"
   - Just questions maybe??? One person starts laying down nodes, and the other person asks questions / leans into curiosity and they take turns
   - Check-out, "How do you feel now, how do you feel that went, what are you doing after this?"

   - collaborators nominate arbitrator to be confirmed by voters?
   - arbitration decides if collaboration achieved?

## ⚒ ## "Meet in the middle"
   - There's something interesting about starting from two different nodes (imagining a coggl board)
   - And trying to find agreement in the middle, whilst ruling in / out things that are disagreed on
   - "Yeah I'll sign on to that"
   - [[meet in the middle.png]]

## 🔛 Vamp: ## Scott V Glen + Scott & Glen
   - "There is immense value in asking thought leaders to enter into a dialectic in a way where:"
      - Progress is made
      - It's accessible to a wide audience

   - "What tool could you throw at Klien & Haris, or Alexander & Wyl, and have a reasonable shot at getting some kind of consensus"

   - "When two public intellectuals take the time to hash through their differences in a legible fashion, it's useful work and they should be rewarded"
      - "professional opinion haver / professional dialectical" getting paid to hash things out with other pundits
      - their work is then an artifact available for consumption, kind of like a podcast

   - You could then crowd fund dialectics / adversarial collaborations between 

   - "Foreground dialectics"
      - Focusing on the hard work of dissolving disagreement, without getting derailed
   
   - The legal system works this way, except consensus isn't seem as the ultimate end goal by the lawyers I guess

## 🔥 Intractable becoming tractable
   - There's a similar intuition with whentho, like the intractable feeling of 5 people across timezones finding coherence around a time
   - Like, how seemingly impossible it is to reach agreement across different ontologies and ideologies, similar to timezones
   - But instead of a time to meet, you get actions

## 💣 Failure Modes
   - 🔒 Impenetrable
      - People needing the whole picture in order to understand any of it
      - Where there's a rich terrain of understanding, but it's impenetrable to law makers or the lay person

      - You could use the multi-canvas feature to create higher and higher level representations

      - "if you show someone a knowledge map cold it's fucked, it needs to be in their head a-priori in order to work with it"

   - ☀ The Fusion Problem
      - Similar to the Impenetrable failure mode
      - People "fuse" with representations of thought, which is to say they have an index/map in their head and they understand the bigger picture
      - This fusion takes activation energy, and maybe is enabled by making concrete claims
      - "Lizards are not real" -> wtf why, there's energy to use for fusing?

   - 👩‍💻 The Technical Bottleneck Problem
      - Building software always takes longer than you think
      - If you can't stay technically agile it creates massive problems / slow downs

      - [[project-lever]]
      - [[100X programmer swat team hacker squad]]
      - [[people I would hire]]
      - an intuition around types, boring technology, and nailing fundamentals
      - funding to hire the best to do the best work of their lives

## 🎙 Dialogues I'd love to see
   - [[harris-v-klien]]
   - [[Jarred vs Liam]]
   - Contra points VS JK Rowling
   - Alexander V Wyl
   - Elizier V Marc Andreson
   - zvi VS zvi

Times you wanted it
   - When you were talking to Steve and John

## 💰 Funding
   - People put money towards dialectics they would love to see happen
   - Quadratic funding matching pool?

## ☁ Misc Thoughts
   - "Like a cross between a research paper and a legal case, both & and V"
