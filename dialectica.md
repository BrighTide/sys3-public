"I will raise a temple within which my Gods can pray, or we will fade away trying"

"Helping humans relate to complex phenomenon that may kill us all"

"Whither the argument may blow, thither we go."

"debate samara"

"paragraphs are bullshit"

"responding to the way unskilful disagreement feels"

"Helping autists communicate at the depth they crave"

"A tool that facilitates two people building a web of agreement and disagreement"

"Facilitating 1-1 representational disagreement"

"Putting head sinks and exhaust on the engine that is disagreement"

I'm looking at this stuff Liam wrote about EA, I find it so violently offensive and immensely frustrating
There has to be a way... to work with, to engage with this
I want to build a way

"The internet had been great for thesis and anti thesis, we can make something that optimises for synthesis"

The opposite of twitter. Slow, deliberate, 1-1, and strong affordances for keeping things private

Thesis: the speed at which a dialectic resolves can be greatly increased by methodological changes

Logo: two circles reaching out to one another within a larger one

"dialectica is the result of two phenomenon
   - 1. what is good about a whiteboard
      - table management, shared scratch pad
   - 2. what's good about great conversation
      - the branching and demarcating nature of a good conversation
      - teasing out seeming, offerings, tryng to build a shared reality
      - definitions, frames, predictions, digressions

## üí† Seems Important
   ü¶† LOGO-METABOLISM:  Dialectica's key purpose is to facilitate logo-metabolism, eating the ideas of others
      - Metabolising ideas does not only involve reading, or understanding, but indexing it and contextualising it, which is to say, forming a relevance and relationship map for knowing what's important and table management

   üç¨ DISCOVERABLE SENSEMAKING: An individual who investigates stuff, but isn't popular, has nowhere they can put their findings and expect others to find them. - Pipegrass

      This ^ could be helped by "everything is organised by question"

      "anyone can add chains of thought to a question, and you can see them if you'd like"

      Being able to include one's thoughts within a Question
      Where your thoughts can be highly refinded / marked up / readily easily available for consumption

      You can see their numbers at a glance, and dig into where they came from

      "see the takes of others"

      this is inline with the key value proposition of the software

      *thought editor*
      *make it as easy as possible for others to eat your ideas, and for you to carve up and eat the ideas of others*

   üß± MOAR THESIS:      Thesis is under-supplied. Even more so thesis that directly addresses it's primary anti-thesis
      "Making conversions is not my department, I only persecute heresy"
      people not seeing it as their job to state their premisses, or trying to figure out where the gaps are and helping you understand
      no thesis only anti-thesis

      Reading the salvos mission statement
      Reading "and / or" in one of the sentences
      And thinking like "I'd love to be able to read the thesis behind they way that is"

      state your premesis

      it seems like there's something important... about the lack of thesis

      "the focus of this process, is stating your thesis"
      "eating someone else's ideas for the purpose of making your thesis stronger"

      13-07-23 18.57: When reading their card you should be thinking about
      How does this make me want to update mine

      What thesis does this bring up that I want to express

      "we lack thesis that speaks strongly and directly to it's anti-thesis on it's own terms"
   
   üö£‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è DEPTH:            There's something quite important about this sense, of operating at a particular gearing / depth, taking other's ideas seriously
                           - in relation to someone else's ideas
                           - taking them seriously

   üëÄ TAKES:            There's something interesting in what it means to have a webs of beliefs, feel dissonance and produce a take
      on "takes"  
         - so you have some prompt
         - and it elicits a web of beliefes + interpretation on how those beliefes relate to the present
         - a "take" is a slicing up of belifes into a coherent narrative

         "collaborative epistemology"

         "we-takes"
            - are when you both have a take, and you try to synthisise a shared one

   ‚öì REBOOT ANCHORS:   Having clear and easy things to "reboot" and "regenerate" from when conversation gets derailed
      - "Reboot from finding coherence"
      - "Reboot from the foil / thesis"

   ü§ù SHARED PROJECT:   Wants to feel like building something together / a shared project

   üß™ PROCESS:          This can't just be a tool, it has to be a process.
      - Or maybe, better to say that the gains from incorperating a process with the tool are big compared to better tooling alone
      - Like scrum. Jira alone VS Jira + the scrum process
      - Maybe a bad example üò¨

   üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è MODERATORS:       People who can embody lawful neutral
      - Those who understand what is being attempted by the project

   üí∞ ATTRACTION:       What would make this tool attractive to the masses?
      - People cheer big for seeing their point of view represented
      - People cheer bigger for seeing person who legibly disagrees with it agree?
      - What are the intricate emotional contoured of the 1-1 representational disagreement observed by a crowd

   ü•ä GRUDGE MATCH:     Team searching for grudge match style show downs in a many communities as possible
   
   ‚ö° AVATARS:          Individuals find themselves all-of-a-sudden channelling the zeitgeist
      "Channeling swaths of disagreement into individual who are given the *tools* and *processes* to hold it productively"

   üëæ MEMES
      06-05-23 16.38: If you want to build software that responds to the phenomenon of dialectic you'll also need to respond to the fact that memes like to grow and or aggress

      06-05-23 16.47: Mike being like "we'll have a beer and talk about it afterwards"
      Respond to the point not the person
      
      Put your response in terms of your own model of how things work / the world you live in / what you see / what seems good and true to you
      
      Let the memes fight, let the humans go home for a beer

## üîÆ What's the dream / elevator pitch?
   - A tool for metabolising someone else's ideas
   - A process for refining your thesis to the most concise "relevant truth in relevant way" it can be

   "To create a context within which one can be as to the process of understanding someone's ideas as I can be to code"
   "When expectations are violated, there's a rolling up of the sleeves. Right, what's going on here"

   "do text editing in the same space as someone, so you can reference their ideas as they evolve, but still keep things separate"

      - *distil the vision / future orientated narrative*
      - tangible prototypes, future oriented narratives
      - what's the dream of the sea?

   - all the "seems importants" in [[dialectica]] and [[üå≤ dialectica roadmap]]

   dream

      - "It would be embarrassing if we never tried something seemingly obvious"

   write down all "seems important"

   1: boundry around whole space

   2: *distils to most nod along "yes seem importamt" that are also maximally dissimimar / surprising*
      - üìå have this available in a public easy to consume format, where it's easy to see how to get in touch with you and or pay you

   1. close boundry around space

   Putting heat sinks and exhaust on the engine that is disagreement
   The internet had been great for thesis and anti thesis
   The age of synthesis is now

   dream focused
   problem focused

   "seems important" focused, some blend of the two
      - dreams and problems are both types of "seems-important"

   a blend of intuitions on solutions and problems that seems important

   it's probably worth bringing in the meta frame you use

   a blend of independent thoughts on the problems and solutions to do with "civilizational coherence"

   call forth a disparate set of points from the ether in a list that makes you go "yes, seems important"

   ingota
      - "that feeling when you can finally see everything relevant"
         - 2020 filmer family coggl

      - "easefully clarify and collapse/compress thought"
         - *watching philippa order and collapse her backlog*


      Dialectica
         - "the intense *hope* in the possibility we could make progress on previously *intractable* agreements"

         - not a patch, but a refactor
         - a process, a way of thinking that sees concord as the final result

         - "being able to generate coherence under adverse conditions of complexity and uncertainty"

## üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What it's not
   - A knowledge graph
      - Thoughts in dialectica are more transient, less computationally amenable, and more embeded within a larger dialoge
      - This doesn't mean they can't have a sense of canonicalness, but it's bounded
      - More the "the hammer and the dance" blog post, and less "the wikipedia page on ants"

   - An argument map
      - The links between the cards have no semantic meaning beyond "this feels related"
      - There's no logical inference to "compel assent"

## üìã The Social Process
   - Check-ins? "How are you today, what were you doing before this, how do you feel about what's to come?"
   - Just questions maybe??? One person starts laying down nodes, and the other person asks questions / leans into curiosity and they take turns
   - Check-out, "How do you feel now, how do you feel that went, what are you doing after this?"

   - collaborators nominate arbitrator to be confirmed by voters?
   - arbitration decides if collaboration achieved?

   - 1. rephrase ideas / make them your own
   - 2. the thing that "needs to be said" / "the relevant truth in the relevant way" will open up
      - there will be some hesitation to saying it, it will feel almost, too obvious to say

   When reading their card you should be thinking about
   How does this make me want to update mine
   What thesis does this bring up that I want to express?

   - It does seem like, there's something
   - Doing a whole lot of dialectica and then
   - Spending like, a day in a hotbox with all the context

   ## Card Types
      - the sense that each card should have an interpersonal goal
      - It should play a role in the conversation, and that role should be known
      - And that role can be fulfilled / unfulfilled with work
         - "This card is positing a claim, we need to do work to ensure it's factored correctly"

Features
   - "Different colours for different people"
   - "A colour for synthesis / statement made together / coherence?"

   - Being able to shift the foil backwards

   - Being able to offer a rephrasing

   - Mutual signing on / off about what in the demarcated graph is shared
   
   - Strong normals & mechanisms around screenshotting / keeping things priviate
      - "X would like to take a screenshot, is this okay?"

   - "Agree and publish"

## üìã The Process
   - Check-ins? "How are you today, what were you doing before this, how do you feel about what's to come?"
   - Just questions maybe??? One person starts laying down nodes, and the other person asks questions / leans into curiosity and they take turns
   - Check-out, "How do you feel now, how do you feel that went, what are you doing after this?"

   - collaborators nominate arbitrator to be confirmed by voters?
   - arbitration decides if collaboration achieved?

## ‚öí ## "Meet in the middle"
   - There's something interesting about starting from two different nodes (imagining a coggl board)
   - And trying to find agreement in the middle, whilst ruling in / out things that are disagreed on
   - "Yeah I'll sign on to that"
   - [[meet in the middle.png]]

## üîõ Vamp: ## Scott V Glen + Scott & Glen
   - "There is immense value in asking thought leaders to enter into a dialectic in a way where:"
      - Progress is made
      - It's accessible to a wide audience

   - "What tool could you throw at Klien & Haris, or Alexander & Wyl, and have a reasonable shot at getting some kind of consensus"

   - "When two public intellectuals take the time to hash through their differences in a legible fashion, it's useful work and they should be rewarded"
      - "professional opinion haver / professional dialectical" getting paid to hash things out with other pundits
      - their work is then an artifact available for consumption, kind of like a podcast

   - You could then crowd fund dialectics / adversarial collaborations between 

   - "Foreground dialectics"
      - Focusing on the hard work of dissolving disagreement, without getting derailed
   
   - The legal system works this way, except consensus isn't seem as the ultimate end goal by the lawyers I guess

## üî• Intractable becoming tractable
   - There's a similar intuition with whentho, like the intractable feeling of 5 people across timezones finding coherence around a time
   - Like, how seemingly impossible it is to reach agreement across different ontologies and ideologies, similar to timezones
   - But instead of a time to meet, you get actions

## üí£ Failure Modes
   - üîí Impenetrable
      - People needing the whole picture in order to understand any of it
      - Where there's a rich terrain of understanding, but it's impenetrable to law makers or the lay person

      - You could use the multi-canvas feature to create higher and higher level representations

      - "if you show someone a knowledge map cold it's fucked, it needs to be in their head a-priori in order to work with it"

   - ‚òÄ The Fusion Problem
      - Similar to the Impenetrable failure mode
      - People "fuse" with representations of thought, which is to say they have an index/map in their head and they understand the bigger picture
      - This fusion takes activation energy, and maybe is enabled by making concrete claims
      - "Lizards are not real" -> wtf why, there's energy to use for fusing?

   - üë©‚Äçüíª The Technical Bottleneck Problem
      - Building software always takes longer than you think
      - If you can't stay technically agile it creates massive problems / slow downs

      - [[project-lever]]
      - [[100X programmer swat team hacker squad]]
      - [[people I would hire]]
      - an intuition around types, boring technology, and nailing fundamentals
      - funding to hire the best to do the best work of their lives
