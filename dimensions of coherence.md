## coherence
   I use "coherence" to mean distinct parts of reality coming into mutual agreement and understanding (aka epistemic and normative harmony)
   *coherence = agreement X understanding*
   such that high agreement with low understanding is relatively low coherence
   and high understanding with very negative agreement is very negative coherence

   different intuitions across the broad space of "coherence" relate to different aspects of what coherence can mean
   "being mis-aligned with reality and being mis-aligned with others are two separate but very related problems"

## types
   [[types of coherence failure.png]]

   we have different processes for being in the world
      - perception      (directly perceiving the world)
      - interpretation  (turning relevant features of that perception into a map)
      - values          (knowledge of what is important)
      - action          (process of acting based on experience, our interpretation, and our values)
      - identity        (how all of this becomes integrated in a process)

   these processes can be all be in coherence/decoherence both with the world, and with others, producing different "types of decoherence"

   experience:       world (perception/illusion)    others (shared-perspective/contention)
      - perception: when you see the world clearly
      - illusion: when the world is not seen clearly (eg, blindless)
      - shared-perspective: when two people have seen similar things, and thus their experience is in coherence
      - contention: when two people disagree about the state of the world, generally because they have seen different things
   interpretation:   world (understanding/delusion) others (concurrence/debate)
      - understanding: when the world is correctly interpreted into a map that reflects the territory
      - delusion: when misinterpretation leads to an incorrect map (bias, etc)
      - concurrence: when two people share similar maps of the world / what is real
      - debate: when two people have different interpretations of what is real
   values:           world (virtuous/malevolence)   others (fellowship/conflict)
      - virtuous: having a correct understanding of morality
      - malevolence
      - fellowship: sharing values / sense of what's important
      - conflict: when two people are in disagreement on what is good
   action:           world (prudent/imprudent)      others (cooperation/defection)
      - prudence: when someone is instrumentally rational / acts for their benefit
      - imprudence: when someone acts against their own interests
      - cooperation: when the actions of two people are in harmony
      - defection: when the actions of two people are not in agreement creating problems
   identity:         world (good/bad)               others (friend/enemy)

   **"right/wrong** is concerned with whether people are in coherence with the world across all levels
      **rationality** is a subset of "right/wrong" typically concerned with fixing individual failures of interpretation and action (and kind of experience), that is, interpreting the world correctly and acting appropriately in response to that and "whatever your values are" (separating into epistemic and instrumental rationality)
      **morality** is a subset of "right/wrong" to do with values

   "concord/discord" is concerned with whether people are in coherence with one another
      **shared rationality** is a subset of concordance concerned with attempts to use models and experience of others to see world accurately
      **negotiation** is a subset of concordance concerned with resolving conflict and defection

## understand VS agree
   - these seem to be important but seperate
   - and also, separate from the world V others

   - to understand something is to have an accurate model of it
   - to agree with it is to not want to change the way it is or yourself
   - "when two things are in disagreement, one must change in order to resolve it. whether me and another, or me and the world"

## teach VS debate?
   - There may be something about the difference between sharing knowledge VS resolving disagreement

## scales
   There are many types of thing that fail to be in coherence:
      - Two separate people can disagree, or not understand one another
      - A person can be in fail to be in coherence with the world (which is to say, misperceive it in some way)
      - Two parts within a person can violently disagree
      - A person's model of the world can be in disagreement with their perception
      - A group's collective understanding can be in disagreement with that of another group

   as the type of thing that is in disagreements change, so two can considerations around how to resolve the disagreement

   resolving disagreement within countries, families, and individual persons all have both shared features and unique challenges

   "The problems and solutions to finding concord changes in some ways as you increase how many parts must cohere (1, 2, 6, 120, +120)"

   "The same issues that underlay IFS appear in large groups too. Parts have roles, there's an instinct to dominate rather than integrate"

   in knowledge management systems, the big scales are generally:
      - personal (pkm)
      - group (notion, g docs)
      - community (twitter, forum, manifold, journals)

## trade offs
   Concordance and rightness can have both a rival and synergistic relationship
      - rightness has an interesting relationship with concordance
      - 1. sibling: you need both to get the ultimate goal (maximum flourishing)
      - 2. rival: there are many opportunities to sacrifice one for the other
      - 3. friend: but also, they can support one another quite well
         - working through discord can be a good and effective way to anneal to what's right ("if can understand why we disagree, prehaps we can understand the underlying reality")
         - discerning what's right can be a good way to settle discord ("we can stop fighting, I found the right answer")

## why important
   Lack of coherence produces suffering and existential risk
   The many and varied combinations of types of thing that fail to cohere disagree produce many types of failure
   
   Different types of coherence failure can involve different solutions
   Coherence between all parts of reality needs focus and improvement, and none can be wholly sacrificed for the other

   I believe that coherence between people is the key bottleneck
   I call coherence between *people* solidarity
   Persons have high solidarity when there is high *mutual* understanding and agreement

   I am interested primarily in improving solidarity without sacrificing other aspects of coherence

## questions
   Q: Why not foreground investigating regality (rationality) and let agreement between persons (concord) follow naturally?
      - Inevitable difference in perspective and experience, there are many flacours of contention

      - If others disagree in bad faith, will make no progress, suspect will still need something to incentivise concord

      - If both in good faith, *can* be much more efficient compare with the maps of others
         - Figuring out who is wrong, etc
         - Empirically, synthesis breeds accuracy and understanding

      - Hard to fit whole map of reality in one person, may always need to have coherence process between persons

      - People have tools to go out and explore reality, the trick is integrating what we find
