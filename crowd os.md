## üí† Ideas that seem important
   ## üå≤ ## Seems Good
      üè´ Make government transparent

      ü§º Make governed transparent 

      ## Participation is popular
         - "Mayors who did not have an "open goverment plan" lost their platform"
         - "people who did have an open goverment plan or who participate in occupt find themselves mayors sometimes without expecting it"
         - "the secret to getting public sector buy in is respecting what bureaucrats value, and valuing their contributions and expertise"

         "Is it the same problem all the way down? We want to feel we belong, that our voices matter, that we're an engaged part of something. Whether in a marriage or in a nation."
         **"This is harder and harder to accomplish productively as you get more people"**
         **Maybe this dynamic of alienation alone can explain much of the trouble in modern society**

      ## FEEDBACK:      "When you give people the feeling that they're capable of interacting with the system in a way that has an effect it's very good. Tools with feedback make Participation
         - You can't just have a tool that eats input and gives nothing back
         - People need to feel their contribution had an effect, like in an rpg
         - feedback, feedback,feedback ![](/assets/2022-04-28-10-26-03.png)

         Revolt of the public / narrow coriddor
            feedlack loop of your agency in the group
            I brought this up and then something happened
            People *lept* to ask me questions, integrate me

      ## Social process
         there's both a technical and a social process that would underly this effort
         the technical could be conceptualised as helping people externalise their internal models of agency
         god, defering this process of collective agency to social media is such a bad idea, it's a wonder it works at

      ## Open Platforms
         - Similar to being able to hack your sys3
         - It seems good for sys4's to be open source / open to change

      ## Polling is good
         listening at scale
         
         - It seems like, there's something important about improving our ability to communicate with politicians
         - "the future of voting"

         "the public will never go for that"
         "well let's, fuckin ask em?"

         in the boat going past an appartment building
         "The council that approved that got voted out"
         If they could have known that ahead of time..

      ## Liquid Democracy
         Using some kind of stance factoring to see who you'd like to assign votes to?
         stance factoring + epistemic health scores + blogging + past voting history

      ## Stance Factoring
         - Stance factoring seems important in crowds, the po.is intuition

         - having easy to parse high information representations of factions and what they believe seems important / helpful
         - stelaris like faction table with percentages of who falls in it?

      ## Pol.is
         vTaiwan uses a tool created by the Seattle-based nonprofit Pol.is that applies machine learning to help large groups achieve consensus through civil debate. A key feature keeping the debate constructive is that everyone must offer ideas by posting comments. Others can click ‚Äúagree‚Äù ‚Äúdisagree‚Äù or ‚Äúpass‚Äù on these ideas, but there is no ‚Äúreply‚Äù function ‚Äì a practice that invites trolling. As the debate unfolds, Pol.is creates an interactive map grouping people according to viewpoints and showing areas of agreement.  

         pol.is is a tool focused on revealing the dimensions of consensus and disagreement within a group
         we see:
            - the issues typically boil down to a few core comments
            - 10x more people vote than comment (if the only medium is comment, that's all you'll see)
            - consensus can co-exist with strong disagreement

      ## Shared Myths
         - It seems quite helpful when all the people have a shared idea of what they're on about

         - The first couple chapters of Sapiens on groups under the dunbar number and shared myths

      ## Self understanding
         Open Mandate: "healing the legitimacy crisis"

         It seems there's something important about society at large being able to understand itself
         What parts of it exist, where there is friction and where there's agreement

         theory of change: help society make sense of itself and the world
         "lets query the voice then" where the voice is an aggregate speaker of the common view/value

      ## Distilling Agreement
         - Finding broad consensus seems important

      ## Measure effect with existing polling data
         omgf 
         targeting districts where there are existing measures of what we're trying to do

         can we increase pollong dat?
         can we take a random selection of disticts and make the govener more popular?
         voting already encodes for a lot
         of we can demonstrate it helps, that's very helpful to get buy in
         what metrics correlate eith the polling data?
         number of steeards, meetings etc?
         existing wellbeing surveys
         could run the survey in the organisation app?
         having clear metrics of what we expect out program to increase would be helpful for getting funding, also for working with politicans

      ## Incentivise seeking oppertunities for agree
         - When people do useful work it's good if that's rewarded
         - how could you incentives narrative sense making? How could you have a society where the sense making web is a key part of the new 4th estate and it generates money consummate with it's value?

      ## Civic participation
         - Opening up the technological underpinnings of the government
         - ‚ÄúAs soon as people got concerned, it didn‚Äôt just get channeled into panic. ... They just built the tools, they went to the tools instead of raiding their local stores.‚Äù

      Getting Canceled
         - It's always integration, just like it's always circling
         - Hold space for disagreement, let their voices be heard

   ## üí£ Seems Problematic
      ## Degraded bottom up sense-making
         - society needs people on the ground to be making sense of what's going on, talking with other people about it, and then feeding that information into governing institutions
         
         - "narrow corridor + revolt of the public" = inadequate bottom up sense making

         - "Maybe the constraint at the moment isn't governmental transparency, but bottom up sense making. Be able to put forward / pulling a coherent agenda from the public"

      ## Norms degrade
         there are vital shared ideas in the culture people don't realise are load bearing, so they put weight on them and it's bad
         freedom of speech, liberty, constitution
         fraying the imagined order, not realising how vital it is

      ## Inability to build
         - We used to be able to build bridges in 5 years, now it takes 20

      "pacific" suggestions
         how do you deal with "pacific" suggestions, wastes of time or minor issues, without causing alienation
         like, changing the name of west end to the indigenous name
         like "yeah, that would be such a small change I'd be afraid to grant it based on letting go of power"

         an agenda that gets voted on maybe?
         or just on the fly voting in general, being able to appeal

      ## Technocrat not focus on legibility
         "The fundamental problem with technocracy on which I will focus (as it is most easily understood within the technocratic worldview) is that formal systems of knowledge creation always have their limits and biases. They always leave out important consideration that are only discovered later and that often turn out to have a systematic relationship to the limited cultural and social experience of the groups developing them. They are thus subject to a wide range of failure modes that can be interpreted as reflecting on a mixture of corruption and incompetence of the technocratic elite. Only systems that leave a wide range of latitude for broader social input can avoid these failure modes."

         "Designers must explicitly recognize and design for the fact that there is critical information necessary to make their designs succeed that a) lies in the minds of citizens outside the technocratic/designer class, b) will not be translated into the language of this class soon enough to avoid disastrous outcomes and c) does not fit into the thin formalism that designers allow for societal input."

         "In order to allow these failures to be corrected, it will be necessary for the designed system to be comprehensible by those outside the formal community, so they can incorporate the unformalized information through critique, reuse, recombination and broader conversation in informal language. Let us call this goal ‚Äúlegibility‚Äù."

      ## Identity is hard
         - Big limitations on systems is that it's hard to restrict to one person alone

## Product ideas
   - Better Polling:          Next generation polling infrastructure with verified identity, cohorts, and stance factoring that gets national coverage
      - "Decentralised democratic polling done right"

      - Could be a protocol?
      - could support prediction

      - Especially useful for academics + industry

   - Open Legislation:        shelling point to read and comment on legislation
      - a shelling point / forum to read and comment and highlight legislation??
      - could have github integration

      just being able to fkn, go somewhere and see all the laws
      *why* can't we do that, *why* are people allowed to do this?
      and to comment, to synthise the opinion
      lile khali but eith all laws / government actions

      it's kind of crazy that there's no cannonical wiki of the laws and the reasoning behind them

   - Canonical debate graph:  society library, but decentralised and for the nation as a whole

   - Canonical Poll:          pol.is + canonical debate
      - scale the polling up to millions of people
      - have canonical debate things like "here's the thing for X"
      - poll people once a day or something and use AI to generate bland agree/disagree statements like vote compass
         > "None of the above have adequate nuance"
         > "Select the three closest to help us triangulate your opinion"
      polling + sense making + discussion + communication + negotiation
      (truth focused bland statement reporting) + (pol.is Style opinion factoring) 
      - whelp, it's the time of day to weigh in
